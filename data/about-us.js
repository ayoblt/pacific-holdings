    title: "OUR BRIEF HISTORY",
    description:
      "On the 13th of December 1983, the Vision of the Pacific Group of Companies was birthed through the establishment of Pacific Drilling Company, a limited liability company which specialized in geophysical surveys, the drilling of boreholes and delivery of water treatment services. By 1990, Pacific had added 3 more businesses to its rapidly growing portfolio of companies and successfully transitioned from being a single business into an emerging conglomerate. In the anticipation of its growth trajectory and positioning for the future, Pacific Holdings Limited was incorporated on the 28th of December 1990 with the primary purpose of grouping all business concerns under one umbrella. Today, having restructured and streamlined its portfolio of companies as part of its long-term strategy, Pacific Holdings currently consists of two major entities with interests in Freight Services and Energy/Power Generation sectors.",
